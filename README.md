# pggosync - WORK IN PROGRESS
A tool for syncing data between Postgres databases. This tool is inspired by the Instacart tool https://github.com/ankane/pgsync. I built this tool as an exercise for learning Golang.

That said, I would **NOT** recommend this for any production uses. Use at your own risk.
